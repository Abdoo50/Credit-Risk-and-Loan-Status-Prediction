# Credit Risk and Loan Status Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for a machine learning project focused on Credit Risk Analysis and Loan Status Prediction. The primary objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of loan default based on various financial indicators.

## Features
- Analysis of financial data related to loan applications.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
- Implementation of machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various financial attributes such as age, education, employment history, income, debt, credit history, and loan default status.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- [Other dependencies as required by the project]

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdoo50/Credit-Risk-and-Loan-Status-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Navigate to the Jupyter notebook `credit-risk-analysis-and-classification.ipynb` to view the analysis and model implementation. You can run the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
